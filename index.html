      In the Flux pattern, the Store is a very important piece because it acts as the single source of truth for data management. This is a crucial concept in understanding how React development works and one of the most touted benefits of React. The beauty of this discipline is that at any given state of our app we can access the AppStore‘s data and know exactly what’s going on within it. There are a few key things to keep in mind if you want to build a data-driven React application:

      We never maniplulate the DOM directly.
      Our UI answers to data and data live in the store.
      If we need to change out our UI, we can go to the store and the store will create the new data state of our app.
      New data is fed to higher level components, then passed down to the lower-level components through props composing the new UI based on the new data received.
